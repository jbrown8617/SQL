--I used SQL to see which product is the best option for a certain customer. 

SELECT product_name
FROM bank_products;

--I used SQL query to show product names that have a checking or savings product type. 

SELECT product_name
FROM bank_products
WHERE product_type = "Checking"
OR product_type = "Savings"

--I used SQL query to show product names that have a Savings product type and an interest rate of at least 0.75 and has no monthly fee.

SELECT product_name, interest_rate
FROM bank_products
WHERE product_type="Savings"
AND interest_rate>=0.75
AND monthly_fee=0;
