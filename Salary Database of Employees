-- I created a query to calculate how much money is spent on salaries for each department where the total spent is at least $300,000

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_spent
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING total_spent >=300000;

-- I created a query to select all departments that pay an average of at least $70,000 per year

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING avg_salary >=70000;
